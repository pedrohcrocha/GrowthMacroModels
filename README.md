Macroeconomic growth models

The study of the determinants of economic growth is an important field of macroeconomic theory. It has many mathematical models 
which will be transformed into code here.

The models can grossly be divided into two categories: Exogeneous growth and Endogenous growth.

# Exogeneous growth models

## The Solow Model with Technological Progress

Parameters: 

* s = savings
* d = depreciation rate
* n = rate of population growth
* g = rate of technological progress

# Endogenous growth models

## AK model

Parameters:

* s = savings
* d = depreciation rate
* A = technologial coeficient
